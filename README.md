## üöÄ Getting Started Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run SquidStock Survival on your own machine.

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

*   **Python:** Version 3.8 or higher installed. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
*   **pip:** Python package installer (usually comes with Python).
*   **Git:** Version control system for cloning the repository. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/)
*   **(Optional but Recommended) Virtual Environment Tool:** Like `venv` (built-in) or `conda`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
    cd <your-repo-name>
    ```
    *(Replace `<your-username>` and `<your-repo-name>` with your actual GitHub details)*

2.  **Create & Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    This isolates project dependencies.

    *Using `venv` (standard Python):*
    ```bash
    # Create environment (replace '.venv' with your preferred name)
    python -m venv .venv

    # Activate environment
    # Windows (Command Prompt)
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    # Windows (PowerShell)
    .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    # macOS / Linux (Bash/Zsh)
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
    You should see `(.venv)` prefixing your terminal prompt.

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file in the repository root containing all necessary libraries (e.g., streamlit, pandas, scikit-learn, plotly, yfinance).
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    This command reads the file and installs the specified versions of the packages.

4.  **Prepare Your Data (If Using CSV):**
    *   Ensure your CSV file has at least columns like `Date`, `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Volume`.
    *   The `Date` column should be in a recognizable date format (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD`).
    *   Place your CSV file within the project directory or note its path.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

1.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    Make sure your terminal is still in the `<your-repo-name>` directory where your main Streamlit script (e.g., `app.py`, `main.py`, `squidstock.py`) is located.

2.  **Launch the Streamlit App:**
    Run the following command, replacing `<your_script_name>.py` with the actual name of your main Python file:
    ```bash
    streamlit run <your_script_name>.py
    ```
    *Example:* If your main file is `app.py`, use `streamlit run app.py`

3.  **Access the App:**
    Streamlit will automatically open the application in your default web browser. It will also display the local URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`) in your terminal.

## üìù How It Works (Simplified Flow)

1.  **Data Input:** User selects a stock ticker (data fetched via `yfinance`) or uploads a CSV file.
2.  **Data Processing:** Pandas is used to load, clean, and prepare the data (e.g., handling missing values, setting date index).
3.  **Feature Engineering:** Relevant features for the ML models are created (e.g., lagged prices, moving averages, target variables for price/trend).
4.  **Model Training:**
    *   **Linear Regression:** Trained on historical data to predict the next day's 'Close' price.
